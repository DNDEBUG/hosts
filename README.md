# hosts
Hosts block lists

i am more interested in blocking porn

but if i find anything else i'll be listing it too

**Adult.txt**: Sites with adult material, also include scam or fake adult sites

The Adult list is being edited constantly, it might have wrong stuff in it, **BE WARNED**

Sites with **# OK** have been reviewed and confirmed to be working and have adult material

for a site to get a **# OK** i have to first review then scrape all links for other sites i can, so some sites are really boring and i can take some time to confirm them

over **5500 Adult sites reached**

**ads.txt**: Advertisements block list

**gore.txt**: Sites with gore material

**removed.txt**: sites that have been removed from some list for some reason, or sites that don't work anymore, but might come back some day

**useless.txt**: Irrelevant websites or designed to be a waste of time

**HELP ME BUY A NEW HARD DRIVE**
